<p>I was going to shift stories at first because I thought my story didn't fit the scope of the needed variables.</p>
<p>However, I loked at the story and the code again, and realized that I just might be able to create a code to follow my original tale.</p>
<p>That was a great relief to me considering I had no desire to create a whole new story to fit the new code flow.</p>
